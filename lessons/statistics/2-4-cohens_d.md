[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Cohen's d is approximately -0.0887 when comparing the birthweight of the first-borns to all other babies.  The magnitude of this is small (less than 0.1), but still about 3 times that of Cohen's d when comparing the number of weeks to birth between first-borns and others.

The small value of Cohen's d for this comparison suggests no discernible difference between the weight of first-borns and those born later in the birth order.
